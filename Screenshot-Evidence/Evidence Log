## Evidence

Here there is some evidence of the steps performed in exercises 1a, 1b, and 1c.

I have paired with Pablo Valenzuela for this exercise, who now is my collaborator on this repository, and I am his collaboratory on his repository.

I have cloned his repository on my local Desktop:

We have assigned each other an issue. The one he assigned me on this repository can be find among the Closed issues [here](https://github.com/loforteg/ECON622-PS4/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).

I have modified my code according to the issue raised by Pablo:

I have run Pablo's code on my computer, and it works.

For point c, I have successfully merged Pablo's pull request without conflicts:

I have then modified the same line Pablo did on my readme file, in order to generate a conflict:

I have also added a pull request on Pablo's repository, which did not generated a conflict:

Then, I have generated a conflict on Pablo's repository:
