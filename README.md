# ECON 622 - PS 4

In this repository I am uploading all the exercises regarding GitHub in Problem Set 4 of the course ECON 622: Computational Economics with Data Science Applications.
You can find more material about this on [QuantEcon-VersionControl](https://julia.quantecon.org/more_julia/version_control.html).


It's my first time using GitHub; fingers crossed!


## Exercise 1a - Git, GitHub, and Version Control
Exercise 1a is all about creating a repository.

## Exercise 1b - Git, GitHub, and Version Control
This exercise is about collaborating with people, assigning each other issues, and modifying your files accordingly.

## Exercise 1c - GitHub, and Version Control
In this exercise we are going to tackle the possible issues arising when two collaborators modify the same file.
