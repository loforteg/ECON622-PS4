# ECON 622 - PS 4
#### P: I will comment in every line of the README. Hopefully, we will have a merge conflict.
In this repository I'm uploading all the exercises regarding GitHub in Problem Set 4 of the course ECON 622: Computational Economics with Data Science Applications.

You can find more material about this on [QuantEcon - Version Control](https://julia.quantecon.org/more_julia/version_control.html).

## Exercise 1a -- ''Git, GitHub, and Version Control''
Exercise 1a is all about creating a repository. It does not sound very nice

## Exercise 1b -- ''Git, GitHub, and Version Control''
This exercise is about collaborating with people, assigning each other issues, and modifying your files accordingly. My collaborator is very annoying but he is a good person!

## Exercise 1c -- ''Git, GitHub, and Version Control''
In this exercise we are going to tackle the possible issues arising when two collaborators modify the same file. :-D

# I am trying to show something :)
