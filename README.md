# ECON 622 - PS 4
#### P: I will comment in every line of the README. Hopefully we will have a merge conflict.
In this repository I'm uploading all the exercises regarding GitHub in Problem Set 4 of the course ECON 622: Computational Economics with Data Science Applications.

You can find more material about this on [Quantitative Economics - Version Control](https://julia.quantecon.org/more_julia/version_control.html).


It is my first time using GitHub. Fingers crossed!


## Exercise 1a - ''Git, GitHub, and Version Control''
Exercise 1a is all about creating a repository. It doesn't sound very nice

## Exercise 1b - ''Git, GitHub, and Version Control''
This exercise is about collaborating with people, assigning each other issues, and modifying your files accordingly. My collaborator is very annoying.

## Exercise 1c - ''Git, GitHub, and Version Control''
In this exercise we are going to tackle the possible issues arising when two collaborators modify the same file. :D
